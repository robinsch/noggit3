# DISCORD #
You can follow Noggit's development and get the latest build here: https://discord.gg/UbdFHyM

# SCRIPTING #
Noggit can be scripted using the Lua (5.1) programming language. See the [scripting documentation](scripts/docs/README.md).

# BUILDING #
This project requires CMake to be built. It also requires the
following libraries:

* OpenGL
* Boost
* Qt 5

Further following libraries are required for MySQL GUID Storage builds:

* LibMySQL
* MySQLCPPConn

The following libraries are automatically installed:
* StormLib (by Ladislav Zezula)
* FastNoise2 (scripting only)
* sol2 (scripting only)
* lodepng (scripting only)
* nlohmann/json (scripting only)

## Windows ##
Text in `<brackets>` below are up to your choice but shall be replaced
with the same choice every time the same text is contained.

### MSVC++ ###
Any recent version of Microsoft Visual C++ should work. Be sure to
remember which version you chose as later on you will have to pick
corresponding versions for other dependencies.

### CMake ###
Any recent CMake version >= 3.11 should work. Just take the latest.

### Boost ###
Install boost to `<boost-install>`. The easiest is to download a pre-built
package from https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/.

* Any version from the last years should work, 1.60 at least.
* Be sure to pick the right compiler version!
* CMake may not support the latest version yet, if you have bad timing, try picking the second newest if configuring fails.

### Qt5 ###
Install Qt5 to `<Qt-install>`, downloading a pre-built package from
https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-2.

Note that during installation you only need **one** version of Qt and
also only **one** compiler version. If download size is noticably large
(more than a few hundred MB), you're probably downloading way too much.

### LuaJIT ###
_(Not necessary if disabling `NOGGIT_WITH_SCRIPTING`)_
* Clone luajit to `<Lua-install>` using git: `git clone https://luajit.org/git/luajit.git`
* Open up the visual studio command prompt (cmd / powershell does **NOT** work)
  * The program is usually called something like "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 20xx"
  * Usually enough to search for "x64 native" in the windows start menu
  * It will open a command prompt that looks like the normal windows command prompt, but has a bunch of necessary visual studio variables set.
* Navigate to the `<Lua-install>/src` (with the visual studio command prompt)
* Run "msvcbuild.bat" (with the visual studio command prompt)
* If successful, should give a message similar to `=== Successfully built LuaJIT for Windows/x64 ===`

### Noggit ###
* open CMake GUI
* set `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` (path) to `"<Qt-install>"`,
  e.g. `"C:/Qt/5.6/msvc2015"`
* set `BOOST_ROOT` (path) to `<boost-install>`, e.g. `"C:/local/boost_1_60_0"`
* (**unlikely to be required:**) move the libraries of Boost from where
  they are into `BOOST_ROOT/lib` so that CMake finds them automatically or
  set `BOOST_LIBRARYDIR` to where your lib are (.dll and .lib). Again, this
  is **highly** unlikely to be required.
* set `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` (path) to an empty destination, e.g. 
  `"C:/Users/blurb/Documents/noggitinstall`
* set `LUA_INCLUDE_DIR` to `<Lua-install>/src`
* set `LUA_LIBRARY` to `<Lua-install>/src/lua51.lib`
* configure, generate
* open solution with visual studio
* build ALL_BUILD
* build INSTALL

To launch noggit you will need the following DLLs from Qt loadable. Install
them in the system, or copy them from `C:/Qt/X.X/msvcXXXX/bin` into the
directory containing noggit.exe, i.e. `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` configured.

* release: Qt5Core, Qt5OpenGL, Qt5Widgets, Qt5Gui
* debug: Qt5Cored, Qt5OpenGLd, Qt5Widgetsd, Qt5Guid 

and copy the following DLLs from from `C:/Qt/X.X/msvcXXXX/plugins/platforms` into the `platforms`
directory containing noggit.exe

* release: qdirect2d, qminimal, qoffscreen, qwindows
* debug: qdirect2dd, qminimald, qoffscreend, qwindowsd

* If using scripting, you will also need to copy `<Lua-install>/src/lua51.dll` to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`

## Linux ##

These instructions assume a working directory `<Linux-Build>`, for example `/home/myuser/`

### Dependencies ###

On **Ubuntu** you can install the building requirements using:

```bash
sudo apt install freeglut3-dev libboost-all-dev qt5-default libsdl2-dev libbz2-dev
```

### LuaJIT ###

From `<Linux-Build>`, build luajit using:
```bash
git clone https://luajit.org/git/luajit.git
cd luajit
make
sudo make install
cd ..
```

`<Linux-Build>/luajit` should now exist.

### Build Noggit ###

From `<Linux-Build>`, clone Noggit3 (change repo as needed):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wowdev/noggit3
```

`<Linux-Build>/noggit3` should now exist.

From `<Linux-Build>`, compile and build using the following commands. 
Note that `<Linux-Build>` should be written as the **full** path in the commands below.
For example: `cmake -DLUA_LIBRARIES=/home/myuser/luajit/src/libluajit.so -DLUA_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/myuser/luajit/src ../noggit3`

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DLUA_LIBRARIES=<Linux-Build>/luajit/src/libluajit.so -DLUA_INCLUDE_DIR=<Linux-Build>/luajit/src ../noggit3
make -j $(nproc)
```

Instead of `make -j $(nproc)` you may want to pick a bigger number than
`$(nproc)`, e.g. the number of `CPU cores * 1.5`.

From `<Linux-Build>/build`, if the build pass correctly without errors, you can install the default lua scripts using:
```bash
cp -r ../noggit3/scripts ./bin/scripts
```

You can now go into `<Linux-Build>/build/bin` and run noggit.

Note that `make install` will probably not work.

# Building the Scripting documentation #
To generate the scripting API documentation, install any new version of Node.js and run: 

```
npm i -g typedoc@0.20.28 typedoc-plugin-markdown@3.5.0 typescript@4.0
```

Then, enter the "scripting" directory in this repository and run the following commands:

```
typedoc --disableSources --plugin typedoc-plugin-markdown --hideBreadcrumbs --out docs/api global.d.ts
rm docs/api/README.md
```

# DEVELOPMENT #
